KCemu 0.3.8

  * initial support for GIDE interface that allows to connect
    up to two IDE hard disks (or CF-Cards) to the KC85
  * added module digital in/out (M001) that contains one
    PIO and one CTC
  * added emulation of the so called KC85/5 which is a KC85/4
    with expanded RAM (replaced internal 64k system RAM with
    256k) and ROM (16k CAOS, 32k BASIC+USER); it uses the new
    CAOS 4.4
  * fixed KC85/4 keyboard emulation
  * added emulation of the Kramer Microcomputer (from the book
    "Praktische Microcomputertechnik" and the Mugler PC (PC/M)
    presented in the magazine "Funkamateur"
  * added segmented RAM memory modules M036 (128k), M032 (256k),
    M034 (512k), M035 (1M) and M035x4 (4M)
  * fixed 16k RAM module M022
  * fixed memory bank switching of RAM8
  * added config file entry and command line option to
    enable/disable the display effects for scaled screen
    output
  * added emulation of the display effect caused by screen
    memory access on KC85/2 and KC85/3
  * fixed basic module for KC85/2
  * added support for basicode files (incomplete, but it's
    possible to add basicode files in ASCII format to a
    tape archive and load them using the load function of
    a bascoder)

KCemu 0.3.7

  * Windows Port using GTK-Win32
  * added emulation of the Polycomputer 880
  * upgrade to GTK+-2.2.1
  * fixed display cache handling
  * fixed keyboard reset bug
  * relaxed file type checking for standard tape files; now
    most .KCC files should be loadable
  * fixed cpu timing and display resolutions for BIC/A5105
  * fixed text output in graphic mode for BIC/A5105
  * added 192 KByte RAM/EPROM module for KC85/1
  * added joystick module M008
  * added Z1013 emulation
  * added 256k RAM-Floppy module for Z1013
  * added BIC/A5105 emulation
  * added CPM-Z9 emulation (CP/M for KC87 using a floppy
    and a 64k RAM module)
  * started emulation of the plotter XY4131
  * added autostart for BASIC programs in KC85/1 and
    KC87 mode (BASIC must be initialized first!); autostart
    routine is described in MP 3/89, page 86 ("Basic-Run
    im OS für die KC87-Familie")
  * handle BASIC DATA files (signature 0xd4, 0xd4, 0xd4)
    produced by CSAVE*"FILENAME";ARRAYNAME and BASIC
    LIST files (signature 0xd5, 0xd5, 0xd5) produced
    by LIST#1"FILENAME"
  * work with both libsndfile-0.0.x and libsndfile-1.0.x
  * added simple program to convert TeleDisk images to
    uncompressed disk dumps
  * added loader for disk images produced by the Sydex
    TeleDisk program (only normal compression for now)
  * lots of compile fixes for gcc-3.2
  * added the notion of computer variants to allow to
    differentiate between e.g. the kc87.11 and kc87.21
    model (which have different basic and system ROMs)
  * fixed memory initialization for kc85/1 and kc87
    (fixes MAZOGS)
  * output pin of timer channel 2 is connected to channel 3
    trigger input pin in kc85/1 mode; fixes system time
    calculation
  * added missing initialization for kc85/1 rom module;
    fixes core dump on exit

KCemu 0.3.6

  * added emulation of screen border and 20 line display
    mode for KC 85/1 and KC 87
  * removed BASIC ROM from KC 85/1; it doesn't have a
    BASIC interpreter built in
  * changed memory layout for KC 85/4; fixes FRACTAL4
  * added menu entry to disable the emulation speed limit
  * fixed calculation problem of the main CPUs R register;
    this fixes the missing monsters in JUNGLE
  * added library to load various audio files
  * some juggling in the display code again, now both
    the KC 85/3 and KC 85/4 support the color scrolling
    effect in BoulderDash

KCemu 0.3.5

  * added emulation of the LC 80 computer (thanks to Holger
    Krull for providing the necessary information at
    www.lc80.de)
  * big internal changes in the display code; there is now
    a generic display layer to simplify the porting to other
    architectures
  * started BeOS port to check the generic display layer --
    not quite usable due to some threading bugs and missing
    user interface
  * renaming of files in tape archives is now possible
  * allow adding .TAP files with multiple files with the same
    name (by renaming the duplicated names)
  * fixed some tape handling bugs
  * fixed initialization bug in the display code

KCemu 0.3.4

  * new switch for kctape to add KC85/1 files (only needed
    for COM files)
  * bugfix for KC85/1 tape files
  * simple sound emulation (still buggy, sound is sometimes
    not turned off) -- requires libSDL
  * implemented IRM switch for KC85/4
  * changed interrupt code to handle daisy chaining
    (makes pharao playable, but still with display errors)

KCemu 0.3.3

  * fixed bug in flash handling (diamonds in digger didn't
    show correctly after reset)
  * fixed tape handling, stop button working again
  * fixed typo that prevented the busdrivers to show up
    in the module window
  * added disk image with CP/M tools from the KC-Club
  * allow compressed disk images in 22DISK format
  * fixed floppy selection when writing data, file copy
    (e.g. from disk B: to disk C:) should now work correctly
  * disk emulation for unix directories (don't try
    to attach directories with many (e.g. > 100)
    or big files!)
  * emulate 4 disks now
  * disk handling partially functional
  * use cppunit for unit tests

KCemu 0.3.2

  * released a debian binary package of KCemu v0.3.2
  * added manpages because the debian packaging system
    requires them
